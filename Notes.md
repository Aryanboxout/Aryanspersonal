5.3 and 5.4 Notes


Bias is everywhere, computers are created by humans and if they are developed by non diverse groups they
are in risk of showcasing bias. Bias can be harmful and cause stereotypes. Decentralazation and elimination 
of a central source can reduce bias, getting the whole circle is important and can help. Also feedback is extremely
helpful in eliminating bias. Crowdsourcing can help eliminate this bias as you try to gain opinions from a wide
variety of people, which helps collect the circle.
