5.3 and 5.4 Notes


Bias is everywhere, computers are created by humans and if they are developed by non diverse groups they
are in risk of showcasing bias. Bias can be harmful and cause stereotypes. Decentralazation and elimination 
of a central source can reduce bias, getting the whole circle is important and can help. Also feedback is extremely
helpful in eliminating bias. Crowdsourcing can help eliminate this bias as you try to gain opinions from a wide
variety of people, which helps collect the circle.

|This week | [ Binary and hexidacemial review](I found a few goof khan academy videos explaining binary, then i am going back to the tpt reviewing this. College board also provides videos on this concept. 
These are my notes I took from this weeks review- Binary is a 2 digit number system that computers used to process data (1s and 0s)
The lowest binary digit is a bit, and there are 8 bits in a byte
Binary physically represents an on/off switch
For each binary digit, there is a decimal place that is 2x
We use abstraction to simplify a more complicated idea to focus on a simpler main idea
Binary is a way to represent data (words, pictures, texts, sounds, color)
Computers are based on binary which are based on numbers
