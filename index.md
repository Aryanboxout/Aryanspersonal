Study Plan

After taking this weeks final quiz, I recieved a 40/50 and I feel very confident in taking the ap exam. I believe I need to work on Binary and hexidacamel. Then I am going to go over fault tolerance,majority of questions I missed was on this concept

|This week | [I found a few goof khan academy videos explaining binary, then i am going back to the tpt reviewing this. College board also provides videos on this concept. These are my notes I took from this weeks review- Binary is a 2 digit number system that computers used to process data (1s and 0s) The lowest binary digit is a bit, and there are 8 bits in a byte Binary physically represents an on/off switch For each binary digit, there is a decimal place that is 2x We use abstraction to simplify a more complicated idea to focus on a simpler main idea Binary is a way to represent data (words, pictures, texts, sounds, color) Computers are based on binary which are based on numbers][ Binary and hexidacemial review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpuPe81bc2w ) | 
|next week| [Fault tolerance](Defintion in simple terms is that fault-tolerance refers to the system's ability to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions. I am going to watch the college board videos and review tpt notes for this topic )|
